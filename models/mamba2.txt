consider the SSM for a single channel of an embedding sequence. it is a sequence to sequence 
map (l,) -> (l,) using structured matrices A, B, and C of shapes (l,), (l, n), and (l, n)
respectively where n is d_state. the 1-SS matrix M of shape (l, l) transforms the loop

y = []
h = jnp.zeros(n)
for a_t, B_t, C_t in zip(A, B, C):
    h = a_t * h + B_t * x_t  # () * (n,) + (n,) * () = (n,)
    y.append(h @ C_t.T)  # (n,) @ (n,).T = ()
y = jnp.array(y)  # (l,)

into a single matrix multiplication

y = M @ x  # (l, l) @ (l,) = (l,)

we see below how. the tensors involved are

x_t: ()
a_t: ()
B_t: (n,)  
C_t: (n,)

the recurrence as seen above is

H_t = a_t * H_{t - 1} + B_t * x_t  # (n,)
y_t = H_t @ C_t^T  # ()

where a_t, B_t, and C_t are shared across channels and are discretized before computing the recurrence

we can expand the recurrence to see a pattern

H_{-1} = 0  # (n,)

H_0 = a_0 * H_{-1} + B_0 * x_0
...
H_{l - 1} = a_{l - 1} * H_{l - 2} + B_{l - 1} * x_{l - 1}  # l hidden states

expanding from H_{l - 1}

H_{l - 1} = a_{l - 1} * (a_{l - 2} * H_{l - 3} + B_{l - 2} * x_{l - 2}) + B_{l - 1} * x_{l - 1}
          = (a_{l - 1} * a_{l - 2}) * H_{l - 3} + a_{l - 1} * B_{l - 2} * x_{l - 2} + B_{l - 1} * x_{l - 1}

expanding until we get to H_{-1}, we have 
          
H_{l - 1} = (a_{l - 1} * ... * a_0) * H_{-1} + (a_{l - 1} * ... * a_1) * B_0 * x_0
                                             + (a_{l - 1} * ... * a_2) * B_1 * x_1
                                             ...
                                             + (a_{l - 1} * a_{l - 2}) * B_{l - 3} * x_{l - 3}
                                             + a_{l - 1} * B_{l - 2} * x_{l - 2}
                                             + B_{l - 1} * x_{l - 1}

then we do the read out

y_l = H_{l - 1} @ C_{l - 1}^T

since H_{-1} = 0 we have

y_l = (a_{l - 1} * ... * a_1) * C_{l - 1} @ B_0^T * x_0 +
      (a_{l - 1} * ... * a_2) * C_{l - 1} @ B_1^T * x_1 +
      ...
      (a_{l - 1} * a_{l - 2}) * C_{l - 1} @ B_{l - 3}^T * x_{l - 3} +
      a_{l - 1} * C_{l - 1} @ B_{l - 2}^T * x_{l - 2} +
      C_{l - 1} @ B_{l - 1}^T * x_{l - 1}

for example

H_3 = a_3 * a_2 * a_1 * (C_3 @ B_0^T) * x_0 + 
      a_3 * a_2 * (C_3 @ B_1^T) * x_1 +
      a_3 * (C_3 @ B_2^T) * x_2 + 
      (C_3 @ B_3^T) * x_3

if you look carefully, you can see that it is equivalent to a masked and weighted query-key dot product
where C is analogous Q and B is analogous to K. the mask for y_t is 

                            0                                           t - 1    t        l - 1
                            |                                             |      |          |       
MASK_{t - 1} = [ (a_1 * ... * a_{t - 1}), ..., a_{t - 2} * a_{t - 1}, a_{t - 1}, 1, 0, ..., 0 ]

let L = [ MASK_0,
          MASK_1,
          ...,
          MASK_{l - 1} ]   # weighted mask
 
      = [ [ 1, 0, 0, ..., 0 ],
          [ a_1, 1, 0, ..., 0 ],
          [ a_1 * a_2, a_1, 1, ..., 0 ],
          ...
          [ (a_1 * ... * a_{l - 1}), ..., 1 ] ]  # (l, l)

L is the 1-semiseparable (1-SS) matrix

the SSM matrix is now

M = L * (C @ B^T)  # (l, l) * ((l, n) @ (l, n).T) = (l, l)

now given a sequence x of shape (l,)

y = M @ x

is the SSM output

if x is of shape (l, dh) (multiple channels), the same equation applies
